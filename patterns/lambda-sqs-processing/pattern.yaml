# Detailed Use Case
use_case: |
  This pattern demonstrates how to process messages from an Amazon SQS queue using AWS Lambda functions.
  It's ideal for decoupling microservices, handling asynchronous workloads, and building scalable event-driven
  architectures. The pattern includes automatic retries, dead-letter queue for failed messages, and CloudWatch
  monitoring for observability. Use this when you need to process messages at scale without managing servers.

# Prerequisites
prerequisites:
  - "AWS Account with appropriate permissions"
  - "AWS CLI installed and configured"
  - "Node.js 18+ or Python 3.9+"
  - "Basic understanding of Lambda and SQS"

# Implementation Details
implementation:
  language: "javascript"
  framework: "SAM"

# Cost Estimation
estimated_cost: "< $1/month"

# Performance Characteristics
performance:
  latency: "< 100ms per message"
  throughput: "Up to 10,000 messages/sec"
  scalability: "Horizontal"

# Security Considerations
security:
  - "Lambda function has least-privilege IAM role with only SQS read permissions"
  - "Messages are encrypted in transit and at rest using AWS KMS"
  - "VPC configuration optional for accessing private resources"
  - "Dead-letter queue for failed message analysis"

# Limitations and Considerations
limitations:
  - "Lambda timeout of 15 minutes maximum"
  - "SQS message size limited to 256 KB"
  - "Visibility timeout must be configured appropriately"
  - "Cold start latency for infrequently invoked functions"
